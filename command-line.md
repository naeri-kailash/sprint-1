Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

    The command line provides a simple way of interacting with your computer using written commands instead of using a mouse. It makes some tasks such as renaming or copying files that can be difficult or time consuming much easier and more efficient. It also provides greater accessibility to perform more complex tasks.


List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

     pwd - print working directory - tells you the path to the folder/directory you are in including
     cd - can use this to move into a directory contained in your current directory eg if you are in folder 'movies' which contains a folder called 'drama', you can type cd drama to enter that folder
     mkdir - use this to create an empty folder eg 'mkdir newfolder'
     touch - use this to create an empty file eg 'touch text.txt'
     man - man followed by command gives you information about that command
     cp - copies a file or folder
     mv - moves or renames a file or folder
     ls - gives you a list of files/ folders contained in the folder/ directory you are currently in
